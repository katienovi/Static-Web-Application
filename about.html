        <p class="card-text">Stardew Valley is a game that I've been playing for quite a bit. While I'm by no means an expert, I have fun trying to figure out 
        how to successfully run my farm while also annoying every person who lives in Pelican Town. <br> <br>
        
        Last October, I actually got the chance to attend the Stardew Valley: Symphony of Seasons concert. It was touring at the Durham Performing Arts Center (DPAC)
        and I managed to snag tickets to see the show with my mom (but only after they added another date after the first one sold out). I keep the poster up in 
        my dorm room to remind myself fun is a real thing when I'm far into the semester. <br> <br>
        
        I selected Krobus for the Details page partially because of the concert. There was a vote for most popular character there, and he ended up winning. I understand why.
        It seems like every person I talk to is equally obsessed with Krobus. It's kinda spooky. <br> <br>

        Funnily enough, this isn't my first time discussing Stardew Valley for class. Back in my freshman year I took ENG 237, where most Thursdays we would sit down and play Stardew Valley
        while discussing different theories about how we percieve heroes and monsters in video games. Again, Krobus is frighteningly relevant. <br> <br>

        And of course, all credit to the creator of Stardew Valley:
